# mergePDF
a simple python pdf merger that will merge files in local directory in natural order

# Useage:
Just run the script in a local directory that you want your files to be merged,
All pdfs in this dir will be merged to one named "merged.pdf"
Note: if you run it again, "merged.pdf" will be merged in too! 

# Note:
I am not saying that this script if for that you can search your course materials easier for your open book midterms. **Definatly** not
